	<p id="pleft"> The Secret of Golf by Joe Posnanski: <br> <br>
		I love golf, so to me, this was a great read. It has a great format, writing about the epic rivalry between Tom Watson and Jack Nicolas for most of the book, but taking breaks inbetween to give tips to the average golfer that Nickolas and Watson mentioned during their several interviews with the author. This is the one of the three books that have ever made me cry, and I would recommend to any golfer who hasn't read it already. </p>
